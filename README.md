# ScribdDownloader2
A script to get blurred/premium content on Scribd without paying!

### About
Scribd is a freemium content hosting platform that provides many useful documents. However, after the first few page of unblocked content, the rest is all blurred out with a payment request!! YUCK! 

However, the site intrestingly also downloads all the content locally making it very easy to just get the content anyways.

This application, ScribdDownloader2 is only for articles that are purely pictures not PDF's.

### Usage

Run the file "ScribdDownloader2.py" and follow on screen instructions.

### ScribdDownloader2 vs ScribdDownloader3 ??

NOTES: 3 IS NOT INHERENTLY BETTER THAN 2!

3 is more flexible than 2, in that it works for all file types ie pdf and pictures however 2 is more automated! 3 is also avaliable on my repo
